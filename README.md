# traffic-sign-classification-using-cnn
problem statement:
  Today self-driving cars are overtaking the automobile industry where drivers can fully depend on cars. To achieve high accuracy itâ€™s important that cars should be able to understand all traffic rules. In this project, we are going to develop a traffic sign identification problem.

About dataset:
There are many different traffic signs like speed limit, traffic signals, indicating directions(left or right), etc. The dataset we are working on contains 50000 images of 43 classes which are numbered from 0 to 42.
